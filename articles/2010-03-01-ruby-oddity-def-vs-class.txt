title: "Ruby oddity: def vs class"
date: 01/03/2010

So I patched toto to fix the Date class, but when I did so I used `def` instead
of the proper `class`, e.g.

    :::ruby
    def Date
        ...
    end

Instead of the correct syntax, which is:

    :::ruby
    class Date
        ...
    end

Oddly enough, the tests still passed just fine, which is why I didn't find it.
