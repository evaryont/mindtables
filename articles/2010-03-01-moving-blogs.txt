title: Moving blogs...
date: 01/03/2010

So here I am, writing this blog post. I do hope that *this* blog does much
better than my previous blog. I'll keep the older one hosted at Posterous,
maybe I'll even mirror these 2 blogs? Nah, I don't think so. I'm going to try
posting more often, even if that means there is only 1 paragraph of text, rather
than 10.

I'm sure you won't mind. :)

Also, I'm going to fork toto and start hacking it up. First up: Support Temple,
so that other template engines will work smoothly.
