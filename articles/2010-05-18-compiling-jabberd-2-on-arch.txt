title: Compiling Jabberd 2 on Arch
date: 18/05/2010

Once upon a time, I was blogging. Perhaps I should do that some more?

Just a quick pointer to a PKGBUILD I've been working on. I like jabberd2, but
the PKGBUILD that is on AUR isn't so great. Hopefully you all can find this
quick enough!

PAM authentication is the biggest part here. Also a little more clarity. I don't
like stacking multiple `--enable-feature` calls onto the same line. This version
disables all the SQL servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) along with Berkley DB. The
storage is handled by SQLite, while the permissions are handled by PAM. LDAP
and anonymous access is disabled as well. The extra XEPs (experimental and
superseded) are enabled as well.

Well, that about sums it up. Enjoy!

PS: Contrary to my previous statements, I won't be doing the once-a-week blog
posts. Oh, stop complaining. It's not like you were complaining this last month
when I didn't write any, so why are you complaining now? Sheesh, get over
yourself.
