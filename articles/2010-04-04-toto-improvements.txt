title: Toto improvements
date: 04/04/2010

So I've been hacking on [toto][]. You know, the awesome little blog that you can get
running in under 10 seconds? Yeah, that one. It's on [github][], and I've [forked][] it.
Why? Ideas, and to help out! [Cloudhead][] has not only toto, but also settler,
which recently got some exposure. Fixing bugs and what not. Just giving back.

So what have I done? Well, lots of stuff I already did had been pulled into the
main tree, and some of my changes have shipped with version 0.4.3! Currently at
version 0.4.5, my changes since then include the following:

 * [ETag][] headers are now valid, before the 'T' was lowercase. I haven't found
   any real standards, but most other programs/frameworks capitalize the T.
 * Custom permalinks! This was an extensive one. Now you can change the URL
   structure that toto uses to link to individual articles. The default is still
   the same, `/:year/:month/:day/:title/`, but now you can also use any metadata
   in the YAML head of your articles. (e.g. if you added a 'foo: blah' line to
   the metadata, then you could use :foo in your permalinks!)
 * Custom error pages. This one was actually pretty easy, since there was a
   single location where all generate error pages were made. Just a quick swap,
   to use the user's method rather than a built-in one.
 * Miscellaneous tweaks, utility code. The aforementioned changes are the
   biggest ones that affect the users. An example of this are the few tests I've
   added to toto. Again, nothing the user has to worry about, but with these
   tests, I or anyone else knows when they broke something they shouldn't have!

You can get these changes, at least until cloudhead merges them upstream, from
my [fork][forked]. A quick pull from `git://github.com:evaryont/toto.git` should
work as well. The custom permalinks are in a seperate topic branch (I should do
that more often) called, obviously enough, `custom_permalinks`.

Oh, but don't worry. I'm not done yet. Oh, oh no, I haven't even started. Boy,
do I have ideas! Not all these ideas may pan out, but if they do, well. Toto
only has good things ahead!
