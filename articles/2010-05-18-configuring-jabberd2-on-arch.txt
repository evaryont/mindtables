title: Configuring Jabberd2 on Arch
date: 18/05/2010

A follow-up to my previous post..

## A warning

I'm just going to enumerate the changes I did to configure my Jabber server.
This configuration is for a personal server, with a limited amount of users.
Perhaps using PAM can scale to epically large servers, but for my uses, I only
need 1 account working. Namely, mine. Therefore, if you trying to use this
configuration scheme for an enterprise set up, __you are doing it wrong__. Use
LDAP, or MySQL. I don't care.

Now that I got that out of the way, let's see what I did, hm? All of what I did
can be found on the main documentation page; if my explanations are not suitable
for you, try reading the page here for a possibly alternative explanation.

### c2s.xml
    * Set the ID (the name) of the server. Line 125.
    * Use PAM as the authentication module: `<module>pam</module>` Line 334

### router.xml
    * Switch to implicit deny: `<order>deny,allow</order>` Line 128
    * Only allow localhost (127.0.0.1), uncomment line 128 and substitute the IP in

### sm.xml
    * Set the ID of the server, again. **Make sure it's the same as in c2s.xml!**
    * Uncomment line 579, so that new users (PAM users) are automatically created in Jabber-land

### DNS
    * Added SRV records that loop back and point to this server. Perhaps it's silly, but
      it may be necessary. It probably is not.

And that is it. I will update this page as I configure the server some more. As a note,
all the .dist files you see in `/etc/jabberd/` are the original, shipped versions. Don't
edit them, just leave them alone. Useful to keep the originals as back ups in case you need
to fall back on something. (Even if they are not what you want.)
