title: "Real time web: A lifestream using Superfeedr"
date: 19/04/2010

I'm trying to create a lifestream app, but it's real time. Also, it's only for
me, not for anyone else.

Now, this isn't to hard, therotically. Just need to get a list of RSS feeds for
each of the services I use, then just poll them. Push the updates to the client.

But what about the real time part? To do that, you'd need either a rapidly
polling background or some other service to do that for you. [Superfeedr]
does that job quite nicely!

Now, I'd like to use Heroku, but it seems it's infrastructure isn't so
friendly, and I couldn't find any docs. Thankfully, I found [this 'shell
application'][gaeshell] on GitHub, so I have a basis to get started. Though,
it is in Python, not Ruby so this will be interesting, to say the least. I'm
gonna have to re-learn Python.

Stay tuned, folks.
