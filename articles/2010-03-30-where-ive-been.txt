title: Where I've been
date: 30/03/2010

So you all have probably been wondering... "Why aren't I seeing new blog posts
from Evaryont in my feed reader?" (I do surely hope you are using my [feed][],
and not wasting away time refreshing my blog's index page.) I have just not
made any new posts, shame on me! I've already missed one Project 52 deadline, this
one will only just make it. Sigh.

I've found a couple of interesting things, SkillsUSA happened, and Spring Break
has begun! None of these are really excuses, I'm just saying where I was. :) If
I were to really keep up with the at least weekly messages, the overall quality
of messages, I'm sure, would reduce. Or at least, I would post more "Look at these
links I found in the last week!" type posts, which I don't **hate** per se, but I
detest them anyways.
