title: Fixing RSS feeds; poor defaults
date: 02/03/2010

So if you tried using my twitterfeed posted bit.ly link, it linked to
http://127.0.0.1 - localhost, not [my site][] as it should. This post is both
to alert all 3 of my subscribers (if even that! :P) and to also force
TwitterFeed to re-publish the feed. Presumably, over the course of 3 hours, I
will unintentionally spam the 'net with some what useless tweets & dents.

Oh, I've set it up so wonderfully... TwitterFeed is linked to my ping.fm account
which then posts to twitter and identi.ca, as well setting my [Facebook][] status.
The latter part is just weird feeling, but I guess I'll see how well that works out.
Most of the people I've friended on Facebook are not technically literate. That
means 90% of my content is immediately useless for them! Oh well, sucks for them.
I'm awesome, and so is technology. Ignore me at your peril.

On the subject of poor defaults, I find it silly that toto defaults to using
`http://127.0.0.1` hard coded rather than using the domain it's being requested
from. Implicit understanding of the environment (like your 'index' is located at
http://example.com/u/1/blog/ so the developer doesn't have to specify that the blog
is, indeed, in the subfolder of /u/1/blog/) is much easier and saner than having
**every little detail specified in a file somewhere!**

PS: Dear [Identica][], please advertise, and eventually phase out support for
username & password authentication, your support for OAuth. It seems not a single
client actually knows that you do support OAuth, and therefore asks me for my
password. Since I want to use your service, I have to hand them my password.
This is a stupid and incredibly silly thing to do these days, yet you fail do
your part in solving this mess. Please do. And if it turns out that you don't
support OAuth at all even though you advertise it in a user's XRDS file, then
perhaps you need to fix that?
