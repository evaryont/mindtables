title: Amazing CSS design
date: 14/03/2010

So I was reading my twitter stream, like I always do. But, this time around, @[cloudhead]
had linked to [Kroc Camen]'s website, along with his CSS. He created his entire site
in HTML5, but **without any <div>, <span>, id's or classes!** Also, using a lot of CSS
tricks, Kroc did some seriously awesome things. (Look at any <abbr> tags, go ahead.
Saw that pop-out? Awesome, right?!?)

So I'm going to rewrite my blog/site in HTML5 only, without any divs or spans.
Not sure if I can go id- or span-less, but I'll try reducing the amount of them,
that's for sure.

In other news, I'm working on a social mapping feature, which is less social
and more technical. I'm interested in the relations individual sites have with
each other, whether or not they're explicitly defined. (Like, I'm using
TwitterFeed, but this blog doesn't "know" that.) I'm using a 3 word notation,
then a ruby script to make GraphViz dot graphs. Then everyone can see my crazy
little world. :) I'll release the source on GitHub as well as explaining it
further.
